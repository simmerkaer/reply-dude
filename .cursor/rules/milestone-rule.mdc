Always consult the milestone plan (MILESTONES.md) every time we start working on new features - and notify us when we are diverging from the plan. Check the relevant checkmarks in the document when features are implemented.

Its VERY important that you keep us in check and stop us from implementing features from a milestone further down the road.
